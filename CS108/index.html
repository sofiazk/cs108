I grew up skiing on several different alpine ski racing teams. I placed top ten in the Ski East league four years in a row from 2014-2018. While I no longer race competitively, it is still a hobby and passion of mine.

In high school, I competed on the US national circuit in Congressional Debate and World Schools Debate styles. I was selected to debate on the New England World Schools Debate team where I represented New England against a field of teams from all around the world. I am currently on the BU Debate Society, and in my free time I tutor in public speaking and debate.
